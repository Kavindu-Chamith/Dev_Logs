# Student Form Submission Checker

This is a simple Python script I wrote as the **Batch Representative** of the Software Engineering department to help manage student submissions for Google Forms.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

When I share Google Forms with my batch, itâ€™s sometimes difficult to track **which students have not filled out the form on time**.  
Manually checking whoâ€™s missing takes time â€” so this script helps automate that process.

You provide:
âœ… A list of student numbers who submitted the form (Since Iâ€™m getting the studentsâ€™ numbers from the Google Form, I only need to copy and paste all the numbers into this)  
âœ… The script compares against the full class list

It then shows you:
ðŸš¨ **Which students have NOT submitted yet**

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- The script has a predefined `full_list` dictionary with:
    - Student numbers (like `22CSE0346`)
    - Student names (like `Kalindu`)

- You run the script and type:
    - Each student number who has already submitted (one per line)
    - Type `done` when finished

- The script calculates whoâ€™s missing and prints:
    ```
    Students who have not submitted the form:
    22CSE0350 - Jayami
    22CSE0352 - Nirmal
    ...
    ```
