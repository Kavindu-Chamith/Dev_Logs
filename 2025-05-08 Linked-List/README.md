# Linked List Practice

Today I learned how to work with **linked lists** in data structures.  
I explored two ways:

1️⃣ **Hard/custom way** — creating a linked list by building a `Node` class and writing methods to insert, delete, and traverse nodes.

2️⃣ **Easy/in-built way** — using Java’s built-in `LinkedList` class, which provides convenient methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, etc.

This folder contains both code examples for practice and comparison.

## 💡 What I practiced

- Creating a custom node and linked list.
- Inserting at front, end, or specific position.
- Deleting from front, end, or by value.
- Traversing and printing the list.
- Using Java’s built-in `LinkedList` for easier operations.
